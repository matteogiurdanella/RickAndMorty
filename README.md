# Rick & Morty Character Viewer

A fully featured iOS app built with **SwiftUI**, showcasing scalable architecture, testability, and modern Swift practices using the Rick & Morty API.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This app lists characters from the Rick & Morty universe with:

- Character list with infinite pagination
- Detailed view for each character
- Search by character name, status and species
- Asynchronous image loading and caching
- Structured concurrency with `async/await`
- Accessibility support

Built entirely in **SwiftUI**, this project demonstrates **MVVM architecture**, **SOLID principles**, modular design, and test-friendly service abstraction.

---

## 🛠 Architecture

The codebase is organized into:

- `Scenes/` – Feature-specific views and view models
- `Models/` – DataTransferObjs decoded from the API
- `Network/` – Abstracted service layer using generics and protocol-oriented networking
- `Common/` – Shared utilities and reusable components

The app uses:

- **MVVM** with protocol-based dependency injection
- **Actor-based concurrency** for thread-safe caching
- **Composable views** for modular UI structure

## 🧪 Testing & CI

This project includes automated testing and CI integration to ensure quality and reliability:

### ✅ Unit Testing

- Implemented using Apple’s modern Swift Testing
- Focused on core logic including networking, error handling, and image caching.
- Built with testability in mind via protocol-based services and isolated components.

### ✅ UI Testing

- Snapshot-based UI testing is implemented using [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) by Point-Free.

### ✅ Continuous Integration (CI)

- Powered by **Xcode Cloud**, integrated directly with **GitHub**.
- The project defines two test plans:
  - `Local` – runs full suite including snapshot tests.
  - `CI` – for Xcode Cloud, excluding snapshot tests due to simulator limitations.

> 📌 *Note: SnapshotTesting has some issue in Xcode Cloud environments because of Folder path. Since I couldn't fix it in a reasonable amount of time at the moment the CI plan avoids these tests to ensure stable, repeatable builds.*

## ⚙️ Technical Decisions

### 🧩 Rick & Morty API

The project originally planned to use the Marvel API, but due to instability and downtime, I switched to the **Rick & Morty API**, which provides rich, paginated character data in a developer-friendly format.

### 🧠 Exploring Beyond My Comfort Zone

While my background includes **UIKit + VIPER** and **SwiftUI + VIPER-State**, I intentionally used this project to explore a cleaner MVVM approach with:

- `async/await`
- SwiftUI-only view composition
- Lightweight, protocol-oriented architecture
- Actor-based services for safe shared state
